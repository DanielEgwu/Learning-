          <p>The saxophone is a type of single-reed woodwind instrument with a conical body, usually made of brass.
               As with all single-reed instruments, sound is produced when a reed on a mouthpiece
                vibrates to produce a sound wave inside the instrument's body. The pitch is controlled by opening 
                and closing holes in the body to change the effective length of the tube. The holes are closed by
                 leather pads attached to keys operated by the player. Saxophones are made in various sizes and
                  are almost always treated as transposing instruments. Saxophone players are called saxophonists.</p>

             <P>The saxophone is used in a wide range of musical styles including classical music
                (such as concert bands, chamber music, solo repertoire, and occasionally orchestras),
                military bands, marching bands, jazz (such as big bands and jazz combos), and contemporary music. 
                The saxophone is also used as a solo and melody instrument or as a member of a horn section in some
                styles of rock and roll and popular music.</p>

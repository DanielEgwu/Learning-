                <h3>Definition</h3>
                A mobile phone, cellular phone, cell phone, cellphone, handphone, or hand phone, 
                sometimes shortened to simply mobile, cell, or just phone, is a portable telephone 
                that can make and receive calls over a radio frequency link while the user is moving within 
                a telephone service area. The radio frequency link establishes a connection to the switching 
                systems of a mobile phone operator, which provides access to the public switched telephone network (
                PSTN). Modern mobile telephone services use a cellular network architecture and, therefore, 
                mobile telephones are called cellular telephones or cell phones in North America. In addition
                 to telephony, digital mobile phones (2G) support a variety of other services,
                such as text messaging, MMS, email, Internet access, short-range wireless communications \
                 (infrared, Bluetooth), business applications, video games and digital photography.
                Mobile phones offering only those capabilities are known as feature phones;
                 mobile phones which offer greatly advanced computing capabilities are referred to as smartphones

            <h3>Brands Of Smartphones</h3>
            <p>We have different brands of smartphones in the world, however i would mention the common ones.</p>
              <ul class="ert">
                  <li>Samsung</li>
                   <img src="s22.jpg" width="450">
                   <h4>Samsung Galaxy S22</h4>
                  <p>The flagship Galaxy smartphones are the Galaxy S and the phablet Galaxy Note series.
                    The Galaxy Z series are foldable smartphones. 
                  The Galaxy A series, Galaxy M series and Galaxy F series are mid-range.
                   Other lines like the C, J, and W are discontinued.. With the introduction of the touchscreen Samsung Galaxy S mobile phone,
                    the company's smart-phone line-up was first place in terms of global sales figures for 2011. 
                   Samsung has also established a prominent position in the release of the various tablets in Nigeri</p>

                <h4>Iphone 13 pro max</h4>
                <p>The iPhone is a smartphone made by Apple that combines a computer,
                     iPod, digital camera and cellular phone into one device with a touchscreen interface.
                      The iPhone runs the iOS operating system,
                     and in 2021 when the iPhone 13 was introduced, 
                     it offered up to 1 TB of storage and a 12-megapixel camera.Up to the iPhone 4, 
                     all iPhones and other iOS devices were manufactured by Foxconn, based in Taiwan. In 2011, 
                     new CEO Tim Cook changed Apple's manufacturing strategy to diversify its suppliers. 
                     The iPhone 4s in 2012 was the first model to be manufactured simultaneously by two stand-alone companies:
                      Foxconn and Pegatron, the latter also based in Taiwan. Although Foxconn still produces more iPhones, 
                      Pegatron's orders have been slowly increased: the company made part of the iPhone 5C line in 2013, 
                     and 30% of iPhone 6 devices in 2014. The 6 Plus model was produced solely by Foxconn.</p>
